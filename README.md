## General Information
The server can be joined at `play.unrealm.net`, on Minecraft version 1.19.2. Other (sub)versions are not supported. Since Chunkbase or any other mapper will not output the correct data, you can visit [this custom web-based mapper](http://map.unrealm.net/).

## Modpacks

To be able to join the server, you will need a certain collection of mods which can be found [here](https://1drv.ms/f/s!AumcJK-A0SbRgbU3GftZXkvskKbzKg?e=dm2r1p). There are three different modpacks which you can select:

- *[Minimal](https://1drv.ms/u/s!AumcJK-A0SbRhIJpOZ-D28kjH7_eZA?e=aapek5)*, which only contains the mods required to play on the server.
- *[Recommended](https://1drv.ms/u/s!AumcJK-A0SbRhIJqwMXLLXrv3CAHFQ?e=358Aav)*, which contains Minimal, along with some QOL mods and cosmetic mods.
- *[Advanced](https://1drv.ms/u/s!AumcJK-A0SbRhIJrE0d52RVitDxJrg?e=HoeZTI)*, which contains Recommended, along with more QOL and technical mods for advanced players.

The contents of the modpacks can be found under the installation section below.

You can delete or add mods as you wish. These have been set up for ease of use. The *Server and Client* mod category cannot be removed, or you will not be able to join the server.

### Installation
All mods will run on Quilt. Fabric should also be supported, but has not been tested. Mods like Ok Zoomer will not run on Fabric. This installation will focus on Quilt. If you wish to use Forge, you will have to find Forge equivalents for all of the required mods. This is not supported and I will not offer assistance with installing this.

 1. After downloading you modpack of choice, extract all mods to a new folder.
 2. Go to `%AppData%\.minecraft`, and create a `\mods` folder, if not already present.
 3. Drag all the mods included in the modpack in this folder. Subdirectories are not an issue.
 4. Download the Quilt installer [here](https://quiltmc.org/en/install/client/). Choose the JAR version (universal) when in doubt. If you encounter problems with this installer, it might be that you Java executable is not on PATH. You will have two options, you can either download the Windows executable (EXE) or fix your Java. I recommend the former.
 5. After opening the Quilt installer, make sure you are installing the Client version of Quilt, and not the Server version. The option for this is found at the top of the application.
 6. Select Minecraft version 1.19.2 in the first dropdown menu. Loader version should be the latest version.
 7. The install location should be `%AppData%\.minecraft` and make sure 'Generate Profile' is checked, and press 'Install'.
 8. Open the Minecraft Launcher, you should see a new installation named 'Quilt 1.19.2'
 9. Press 'play'.

If you encounter any issues while installing, contact `tayfaan` or `Tayfaan#4075` on Discord for high quality top-shelf tech support.
